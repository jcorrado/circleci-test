Logstash configuration for Empatico

I'm not sure yet if it will make sense to keep this repo.  It depends on
how we decide to handle testing of configuration and subsequent
deployment.  It might make sense to integrate this directly into the
[puppet](https://github.com/EmpaticoOrg/puppet) repo, for example.

For now, I'm keeping it here as I start to work through refactoring.

Config are presented as ERB templates with credentials removed.
